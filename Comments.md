1. Doesn't have an interface (SOLID principles, TDD)
2. Constructor complexity (more possible services, more complex constructor)
3. If-else "spaghetti code" inside SubmitApplicationFor method
4. Throwing InvalidOperationExceptoin without any handling
5. InvalidOperationException instead of application specific exception
